# heart-disease-analysis
Heart disease has become one of the most concerning and common causes of death in recent years. This
analysis aims to find a better model that predicts the existence of heart disease in a patient by using several
machine learning models. In this way, a patient would be able to find out his or her situation earlier and
hopefully get an early cure out of it.

## Methods
Data cleaning, Logistic modelling, Decision Tree
